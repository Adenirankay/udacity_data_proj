## Dataset

The prosper loan data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.But i selected few features basically for my analysis.


## Summary of Findings

Loans that are past generally tend to have a high increase in interest rate. While others tend to maintain a proper rate until they are defaulted or past. The Borrower APR and Lender yield have a strong positive correlation such that when the interest borrowers pays more , the lender yield will increase. The higher the prosper score lower will lower borrower apr and this makes the lender yield low too. There is a strong correlation pattern between the lender yield and the borrower rate but the estimated loss variable has a less common data with this two(They are less common).


## Key Insights for Presentation

APR rate cuts accross the prosper ratings and the loan amount. It also shows that the loans with higher borrower APR and Lender yield tends to had a lower prosper sore while people with full time and part time jobs had a lower borrower APR in all loan status.
